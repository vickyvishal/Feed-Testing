# Feed-Testing

##Instruction
To view the Jasmine test on the feedreader app, double click on index.html to open in your browser. All the test result will be displayed at the bottom of the page.

##Project Overview
In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, 
they've already included Jasmine and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, 
they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

##Why this project?
Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". 
This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.
Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!

##What will my project test?
1. All the feeds are defined and it is not empty.
2. All the url properties inside the Allfeeds object is defined and it is not empty
3. All the name property is defined and not empty
4. The menu element is toggled properly
5. Atleast one entry element within each feed
6. The feeds are loaded when we click on any feedlist element and it is unique.
